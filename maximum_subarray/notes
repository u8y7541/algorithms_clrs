The program in the directory is my idea to solve the maximum subarray
problem before reading the solution in the book. My solution is essentially
equivalent to the book's, but operates on the cumulative array instead of
the array of differences. Also, my program is more efficient as the function
returns the min and max in the range as well, meaning that it is trivial to
find the crossing subarray and eliminating what amounts to an O(n)
contribution to the runtime. This is still an O(nlogn) divide-and-conquer
solution.
